**Hi there!**

My name is **Bo Peng (彭博)** and I'm a phd student at [NYU Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/). My major is civil engineering, and I'm also pursing my second master degree in computer science at [Georgia Tech's OMSCS program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/). This blog is used to record what I've learned and anything I'm interested in.
